<h2>A lifelong “Yes”</h2>
<p>
GIRLLL, our memories are wide as the ocean and as long as Psalm 119. But every time I think of you, I always go back to remembering my first memory of us as friends.

It was in Methodist church — our mums were sitting right at the back, and you came up to me and said, “do you want to playyyy?” Honestly, I thank God every day that I said YES. We ran up and down, up and down the aisle between the chairs. And every time, it makes me tear up thinking about how much we’ve been through since then. But it always reminds me that no matter where we are in the world, in our lives, or even in our friendship — through the ups and downs… we’ve always got each other.

Like Proverbs 18:24 says: friends come and friends go, but a true friend sticks by you like family.

And that is exactly what you are to me, Sathana Hannah Nathan — a true friend and family. Whether it was eating Kenneth Uncle’s Nutella sandwiches on sports day or taking photos in every mirror or even just our random yapping sessions — that will forever be our lifelong tradition btw — those memories will forever be the ones I hold onto. You are my baptism buddy, my prayer partner and honestly I can't wait to see the memories we make in the future. The worship nights, the dinners, the random hangout days. Every memory we make is gonna be a special one. I can't wait for that, but until then, I'm gonna cherish every moment we have together now.

<h2>A Letter for Your Sixteenth</h2>
<p>
To Sathana,

Happy Birthdayyyy! Honestly, every year on this day, I just feel sooo excited cause this is the day my best friend was given to this world as a blessing. A blessing especially to me. I can’t believe it’s alreadyyy your 16th!! Sure, this next year may be hard, but I pray all the blessings and mercy over it. I know for sure that God has got a great plan for youuuu.

I’m pretty sure we’re just two halves of the same chaotic brain cell — if there’s anyone who gets me, it’s you. From cracking up so hard that everyone stares to being able to send three words and somehow knowing exactly what the other one’s day has been like, our connection is just unmatched. Honestly our friendship is such a great mix of laughter and warmth.

One of my favourite things about you — and there are too many to count — is the huge heart you have. The love you have for people, the way you show up for others, and the way you always make them feel seen is a rare gift. It’s truly such an “I see Jesus in you” thought that I get every time I see you. And of course, your unwavering faith and strength is something that I know will take you to very high places where you will make such big changes to people’s lives.

You’re a person who always reminds me that God is still good even if today wasn’t. And I am sooo so grateful for that 🤍🤍 You truly make my life so much more blessed, funnier, and honestly, just better.

Thank you for being my hug-giver, my prayer partner, my baptism buddy, and for praying for me without even needing context.

I hope you have the most beautiful, joyful, and blessed day. You deserve the world and then some. I wish I could see you, but I hope this slightlyyyy makes up for my absence.

I love you so sooooo much. You’re forever in my thoughts and my heart, and I will always be praying for our friendship to have Jesus at the centre. ❤️
<p>
I hope you like your lipgloss and face mask☺️
<p>
All my love,<p>
Alina Rebecca Deborah Kaunds
